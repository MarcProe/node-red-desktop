## If additional nodes does not work....


- This function uses Node-RED Destktop builtin npm.  
Some npm modules need to be compiled from node binary or C/C++ when installing.  
In such cases, you need to install node.js before.  
If so, please install node v12.x.x from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/) and retry to install them.
  
  You can test to use `node` command with this flow.

  ```

  ```

- In some cases, the error like **NODE_MODULE_VERSION** mismatch occures.

  ```
  [2019-05-24 19:38:00.395] [warn] [node-red-node-serialport/serialport] Error: The module '\\?\C:\Users\abc\.Node-RED-Desktop\node_modules\@serialport\bindings\build\Release\bindings.node'
  was compiled against a different Node.js version using
  NODE_MODULE_VERSION 47. This version of Node.js requires
  NODE_MODULE_VERSION 70. Please try re-compiling or re-installing
  ```
  
  Then you need some step.

  ```
  ## Windows
  > npm install -g electron-rebuild
  > cd %USERPROFILE%\.Node-RED-Desktop
  > electron-rebuild --version 5.0.0
  
  ## Mac
  $ npm install -g electron-rebuild
  $ cd $USER/.Node-RED-Desktop
  $ electron-rebuild --version 5.0.0
  ```

## How to use excluded standard nodes

- You can activate them at **[Nodes exclude]** form in **[File]-[Settings...]**.  
When you activate the MQTT node, Delete `10-mqtt.js` from **[Node exclude]**.

- Default **[Nodes exclude]** is below
  ```
  10-mqtt.js
  16-range.js
  31-tcpin.js
  32-udp.js
  89-trigger.js
  node-red-node-sentiment
  node-red-node-rbe
  ```

- I have selected default **[Nodes exclude]** to simple the first look for beginners.  
There is not technical reason.
